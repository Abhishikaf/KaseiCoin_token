# Application

## Martian Token Crowdsale

A fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library is created.

The crowdsale contract that is created will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract mints the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

## Technologies

This project uses the following packages:

* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Remix is a browser-based compiler and IDE that enables users to build Ethereum contracts with Solidity language and to debug transactions.

* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) - Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
